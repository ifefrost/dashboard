# Dashboard

This portfolio project is a dashboard with dummy data to display my skills in React, Data Visualization, and UI/UX Design. It is built with React, Tremor, and TailwindCSS, bootstrapped with Vite and hosted on Vercel.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Tremor

[Tremor](https://www.tremor.rs/) is a data processing system that provides both a query language and a runtime system designed to process data streams. It is built to be used as a library that can be embedded in other applications to provide data processing capabilities.

## TailwindCSS

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
